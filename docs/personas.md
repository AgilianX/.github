## Using Personas in Feature Development

When planning features:

1. Identify which personas the feature serves
2. Consider their goals, needs, and constraints
3. Define user stories and acceptance criteria based on persona characteristics
4. Test features from the perspective of each relevant persona

## Custom Personas

Projects may define additional personas in their repository-specific documentation as needed for specialized domain requirements.
